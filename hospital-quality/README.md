The Hospital Compare web site contains a lot of data and we will only look at a small subset for this
assignment. The zip file for this assignment contains three files

* outcome-of-care-measures.csv: Contains information about 30-day mortality and readmission rates
for heart attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia for over 4,000 hospitals.
* hospital-data.csv: Contains information about each hospital.
* Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf: Descriptions of the variables in each le (i.e the code book).

A description of the variables in each of the les is in the included PDF le named Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf.
This document contains information about many other les that are not included with this programming
assignment. You will want to focus on the variables for Number 19 (\Outcome of Care Measures.csv") and
Number 11 (\Hospital Data.csv"). You may nd it useful to print out this document (at least the pages for
Tables 19 and 11) to have next to you while you work on this assignment. In particular, the numbers of
the variables for each table indicate column indices in each table (i.e. \Hospital Name" is column 2 in the
outcome-of-care-measures.csv file).

To do:
* Finding the best hospital in a state
* Ranking hospitals by outcome in a state
* Ranking hospitals in all states
